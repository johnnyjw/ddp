* The R function creates an HTML page
* The HTML page calls Google Charts
* The result is an interactive HTML graphic

* This motion chart doesnt work as it uses Flash and Flash is dead!

## Example
```{r gv, results="asis", cache=TRUE}

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(googleVis))
M <-  gvisMotionChart(Fruits, "Fruit", "Year",
                      options=list(width=600, height=400))
#print(M, "chart")


```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
